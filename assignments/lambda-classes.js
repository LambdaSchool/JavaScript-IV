// CODE here for your Lambda Classes



/*

* We have a school to build here! This project will get you used to thinking about classes in JavaScript and building them from a brand new data set.
* Lambda personnel can be broken down into three different types of `people`.
  * **Instructors** - extensions of Person
  * **Students** - extensions of Person
  * **Project Managers** - extensions of Instructors
* **IMPORTANT** - You'll need to create 2 - 3 objects for each class and test them according to their unique Attributes. For example:


#### Person

* First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
* Person receives `name` `age` `location` `gender` all as props
* Person receives `speak` as a method.
* This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name` and `location` are the object's own props

#### Instructor

* Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Instructor class.
* Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
* Instructor has the following unique props:
  * `specialty` what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
  * `favLanguage` i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
  * `catchPhrase` i.e. `Don't forget the homies`
* Instructor has the following methods:
  * `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
  * `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'

#### Student

* Now we need some students!
* Student uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
* Student has the following unique props:
  * `previousBackground` i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
  * `className` i.e. CS132
  * `favSubjects`. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
* Student has the following methods:
  * `listsSubjects` a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
  * `PRAssignment` a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the `student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}`
  * `sprintChallenge` similar to PRAssignment but logs out `student.name has begun sprint challenge on {subject}`

#### Project Manager

* Now that we have instructors and students, we'd be nowhere without our PM's
* ProjectManagers are extensions of Instructors
* ProjectManagers have the following unique props:
  * `gradClassName`: i.e. CS1
  * `favInstructor`: i.e. Sean
* ProjectManagers have the following Methods:
  * `standUp` a method that takes in a slack channel and logs `{name} announces to {channel}, @channel standy times!​​​​​
  * `debugsCode` a method that takes in a student object and a subject and logs out `{name} debugs {student.name}'s code on {subject}`
