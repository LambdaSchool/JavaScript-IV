// CODE here for your Lambda Classes

// Person
// First we need a Person class. This will be our base-class
// Person receives name age location gender all as props
// Person receives speak as a method.
// This method logs out a phrase Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock where name and location are the object's own props
class Person {
    constructor(props) {
        this.name = props.name;
        this.age = props.age;
        this.location = props.location;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`Hello my name is ${this.name}, and I am from ${this.location}`);
    }
}
// Instructor
// Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// Instructor has the following unique props:
// specialty what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
// favLanguage i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
// catchPhrase i.e. Don't forget the homies
// Instructor has the following methods:
// demo receives a subject string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
// grade receives a student object and a subject string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'
class Instructor extends Person {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.specialty = props.specialty;
        this.favLanguage = props.favLanguage;
        this.catchPhrase = props.catchPhrase;
    }
    demo(subject) {
        console.log(`${this.name} receives a perfect score on ${subject}`);
    }
}

// Student
// Student uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// Student has the following unique props:
// previousBackground i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
// className i.e. CS132
// favSubjects. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
// Student has the following methods:
// listsSubjects a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
// PRAssignment a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}
// sprintChallenge similar to PRAssignment but logs out student.name has begun spring challenge on {subject}
class Student extends Person {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.previousBackground = props.previousBackground;
